NFR Modeling with Large Language Models (LLMs)
This repository contains the replication package for the paper:

"Teaching LLMs Non-Functional Requirements Modeling: A Grammar and RAG Approach"
Submitted to 2025 IEEE SSE (2025 International Conference on Software Services Engineering)


It includes code, grammar rules, ontology definitions, and both RAG-based and baseline implementations for generating Softgoal Interdependency Graphs (SIGs).
